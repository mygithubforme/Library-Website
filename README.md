This is library management web application developed in C#.Net 

	â€¢	Library Automation Software as an undergraduate project using RFID 
Technology.

 I have developed Library Automation System with RFID technology (Web application) as an undergrad project with my other two friends.
 Various operations carried out in library uses RFID reader and tag. An application hold the database of books and provide 
 functionalities like viewing the current books, due dates and fine (for members) and searching for the availability of books 
 (for guests). 
 
 A bot scanned the library for misplaced books and will produce a list of such books so that every book remains in their particular place.
 Thus automation will be enhanced to a certain level to current barcode system.

For that, we have used ASP.NET framework and as a development language (MVC model). 
In this project, I have used JavaScript and JQuery as a front end scripting language as well as asynchronous call back technology AJAX 
to provide advanced user experience. We also used Bootsrap for modern user interface. As a back end database I have used MySQL Server. 
I have also developed desktop application in VB.NET which was used to read the data from RFID tag and manage basic functions.
